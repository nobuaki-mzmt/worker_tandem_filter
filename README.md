This study investigates the broadness of tandem running behavior in a termite _Reticulitermes amamianus_. During mating season, mating pairs perform tandem running while looking for a nest site, by males following females. We investigated whether males follow similar to females but non-mating individuals (workers and soldiers). Behavioral observations include posture tracking of laboratory recordings of behavioral interactions. This repository includes the Python/R scripts.

## Table of Contents
This repository includes R and Python code for data analysis. Data is available at Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.20820371.

* [README](./README.md)
* [codes](./codes)
  * [`data_processing_well.py`](./codes/data_processing_well.py), [`data_processing_dish.py`](./codes/data_processing_dish.py) - Format `.h5` files (well experiments) to `.feather` with interpolation and smoothing, for well and dish experiments, respectively.

  * [`output.R`](./codes/output.R) - Visualization and statistics for experiments
  * [`source.R`](./codes/source.R) - for loading packages and functions

## Reproducing the analyses

Data are available from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20820371).
Download the data and place `data_raw/` in the repository root.

From the repository root, run:

```
python -m codes.data_processing_well
python -m codes.data_processing_dish
Rscript codes/processing.R
Rscript codes/output.R
```

## Setup & Dependencies
Scripts are written in R and Python, tested on Windows 11 (64-bit).

### R Environment

The R environment is managed using `renv`. Package versions used in the analyses are recorded in `renv.lock`.
To reproduce the R environment:

```r
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

### Python Environment

Python scripts were developed using Python 3.11.4
Required Python packages can be installed using:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
