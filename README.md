This study investigates the broadness of tandem running behavior in a termite _Reticulitermes amamianus_. During mating season, mating pairs perform tandem running while looking for a nest site, by males following females. We investigated whether males follow similar to females but non-mating individuals (workers and soldiers). Behavioral observations include posture tracking of laboratory recordings of behavioral interactions. This repository includes data and the Python/R scripts.

## Table of Contents
This repository includes tracking data, R code to analyze it, and Python code for video analysis. Trajectory data are not included due to file size.

## Setup & Dependencies
Scripts are written in R and Python, tested on Windows 11 (64-bit).

### R Environment

The R environment is managed using `renv`. Package versions used in the analyses are recorded in `renv.lock`.
To reproduce the R environment:

```r
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

### Python Environment

Python scripts were developed using Python 3.11.4
